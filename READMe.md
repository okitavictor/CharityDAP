# Decentralized Autonomous Charity (DAC)

A blockchain-based charitable organization where donors can collectively decide on fund allocation through democratic voting processes.

## Features

- üè¶ Transparent donation management
- üìã Community-driven proposal system
- üó≥Ô∏è Democratic voting mechanism
- üí∞ Automated fund distribution
- üé® Proof of donation NFTs
- üîí Secure smart contract implementation

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

- `dao-charity.clar`: Main contract handling:
    - Donation processing
    - Proposal management
    - Voting system
    - Fund distribution
    - NFT minting

### Test Suite

- Comprehensive Vitest test suite
- Coverage for all contract functions
- Simulated blockchain testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install -g clarinet
npm install
```

### Development Setup

1. Initialize project:
```bash
clarinet new dao-charity
cd dao-charity
```

2. Deploy contract:
```bash
clarinet contract deploy
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Contract Interaction

### Making Donations

```clarity
;; Donate minimum amount (1 STX)
(contract-call? .dao-charity donate)
```

### Creating Proposals

```clarity
(contract-call? .dao-charity create-proposal
  "Help Local Food Bank"
  "Provide meals to local community"
  'beneficiary-address
  u1000000  ;; 1 STX
  u100)     ;; Duration in blocks
```

### Voting

```clarity
;; Vote in favor of proposal #1
(contract-call? .dao-charity vote u1 true)
```

## Security Considerations

- Minimum donation requirements
- Proposal duration limits
- Vote weight based on donation amount
- Fund distribution safety checks
- Access control for administrative functions

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm test dao-charity

# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage
```
